    <h1>Eastman Kodak Company</h1>
    <p>Eastman Kodak Company is a multinational company founded in 1892 in the United States, dedicated to the design, production, and commercialization of photographic equipment. For over a century, it has been well-known for its cameras and photographic films and is currently reorienting its activities toward two main markets: digital photography and digital printing, although there are rare instances when it focuses on analog photography nowadays. Since 2020, it also commercializes pharmaceutical products.</p>
