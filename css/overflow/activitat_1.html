    <h2>Victorian Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      Victorian architecture is a series of architectural revival styles that were popular during the Victorian era. Victorian architecture is most closely identified with the Queen Anne style that was made popular in the United States during the last quarter of the 19th century. Queen Anne style is characterized by the use of gables, bay windows, and bright colors, with decorative wood trim and shingles, sometimes called "gingerbread."

    <h2>Baroque Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      Baroque architecture is a style of architecture that flourished in Europe from the late 16th century until the early 18th century. It was popular in Italy, France, and Spain, and later in Germany, Austria, and England. Baroque architecture is characterized by exaggerated lighting, intense emotions, and a tendency to blur distinctions between the various arts. Its grandeur is richly embodied in works of architecture such as the palace of Versailles and St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.

    <h2>Modern Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      Modern architecture is a style of architecture characterized by clean lines, minimalism, and a focus on function over form. It emerged in the early 20th century as a reaction against the ornate styles of the Victorian and Edwardian eras. Modern architecture emphasizes simplicity, functionality, and the use of modern materials such as steel, glass, and concrete. Notable examples of modern architecture include the Villa Savoye in France and the Seagram Building in New York City.
